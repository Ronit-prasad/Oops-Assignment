It defines the attributes and method that the objects created form it will have.\n","\n","3: What is an object in OOP?\n","  - An object in object oriented programing is an instance of a class. It represents a real-world entity with in own-data and behaviour.\n","\n","4: What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n","  - Abstraction:\n","    - Abstraction is the process of hiding implementation details and only showinng the necessary features to the user.\n","    - Focus: What an object does, rather than how it does it.\n","    - Example: The Animal class hides the implementation of sound().\n","  - Encapsulation:\n","    - Encapsulation is the process of redirecting direct access to data and only allowing controlled access through getter/setter method.\n","    - Focus: Protects data from unintended modification.\n","    - Example: The __balance attribute is private, so it can't be accessed directly.\n","\n","5: What are dunder methods in Python?\n","  - Dunder method are known as magic method or special method, are built-in python methods with double underscores before an after their names.\n","\n","6: Explain the concept of inheritance in OOPS?\n","  - Key concepts of inheritance are:\n","    - Code reusability: Avoids redundancy by reusing existing code\n","    - Scalability: Allow easy modification and extensions.\n","    - Hierarchy Representation: Represents real-world relationship between classes\n","    - Improved maintainbility: Changes in the parent class affect all child classes.\n","\n","7: What is polymorphism in OOP?\n","  - In OOPS, polymorphism allows one interface to be used for different data types or classes.\n","\n","8: How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n","  - Python does not have strict access modifiers (private, protected, etc) like java or c++.\n","    - Public member:\n","      - Public attributes and methods can be accessed from anywhere.\n","      - Example: Brand\n","    - Private member:\n","      - Single underscore indicates a protected member.\n","      - Example: _balance should be treated as protected.\n","    - Using getter and setter:\n","      - To safely access and modify private attributes, we use getter and setter method.\n","      -  Encapsulation prevents invalid data.\n","\n","9: What is a constructor in Python?\n","  - A constructor is the special method in python used to initialize an object when it is created. It automatically runs when an instance of the class is created.\n","\n","10: What are class and static methods in Python?\n","  - Class Method:\n","   - It can be accessed using @classmethod\n","   - The first parameter are used using cls\n","   - We can modifies the class attributes\n","   - We can't modifies the instance attributes\n","   - Using class method we can access class variables\n","  - Static method:\n","   - It can be accessed using @staticmethod\n","   - In this first parameter we don't have to use self or cls\n","   - We can't modifies the class attributes.\n","   - We can't modifies the instance attributes\n","   - we can't access the class variables\n","\n","11: What is method overloading in Python?\n","  - Method overloading allows multiple methods in a class to have the same name but different parameters.\n","  - In many langauges method overloading is achhived by defining multiple methods with the same name but different argunment lists.\n","\n","12: What is method overriding in OOP?\n"," - Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class.\n","  \n","13: What is a property decorator in Python?\n","  - In python the property decorator allows you to define the getter method in an object-oriented way.\n","  - It helps create read-only properties or control access to instance variables.\n","\n","14: Why is polymorphism important in OOPs?\n","  - Polymorphisms means 'Many forms', it allows object of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.\n","  - In OOPS, polymorphism let a single interface to be used for different data types.\n","  - It enables code reusablity, flexiblity and scalablity.\n","\n","15: What is an abstract class in Python?\n","  - An abstract class in python that cannot be instantiated and serves as a blueprint for other classes. It typically contains methods, which are methods that must be implemented by any subclass.\n","\n","16: What are the advantages of OOPs?\n","  - Advantages of OOPS are:\n","  - Code reusability:\n","    - Allows new classes to inherit properties and methods from existing classses.\n","    - Reduces code duplication and improves maintainablity.\n","  - Encapsulation:\n","    - Restricts direct access to data and modifies it only through defined methods.\n","  - Abstraction:\n","    - Hides complex implementation details and only exposses essential features.\n","  - Polymorphism:\n","    - Allows objects of different classes to be treated as instances of the same class.\n","\n","17: What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n","  - Class variables:\n","    - Defined inside the class but outside the method.\n","    - Shared across all instance of class\n","    - Changing the class variables affects all instances\n","  - Instances variables:\n","    - Defined inside the constructor using self.\n","    - Unique to each instance of the class\n","    - Modifying the instance variable only affects that specific instance.\n","\n","18: What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n","  - Multiple inheritance is a feature in python where a class can inherit from more than one parent class.This allows the child class to have acesss to the attributes and method of multiple parent class.\n","\n","19: Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python?\n","  - __str__ Method:\n","    - Used to create a humman readable string representation of an object.\n","    - called when you print(object)\n","    - Meant to be user-friendly\n","  - __repr__ method:\n","    - Used to create an unambiguous representation of the object, aminly for debugging.\n","    - Should idely return a string taht, when when passed to eval(), can increate the object.\n","    - called when using repr(object).\n","\n","20: What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n","  - The super() function is used in Python for calling methods from a parent (or superclass) inside a child class. It is especially useful in inheritance when we want to reuse the functionality of a superclass without explicitly referencing it.\n","\n","21: What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n","  - The __del__ method is a destructor in Python that is automatically called when an object is about to be destroyed (garbage collected). It is used to clean up resources such as closing files, releasing memory, or disconnecting from databases.\n","\n","22: What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n","  - @staticmethod:-\n","    - Defines a method that does not requires access to class or instance attributes.\n","    - Acts like a regular function inside a class, but its is logically related to the class.\n","    - Does not modify or access class state.\n","  - @classmethod:\n","    - Defines a method that operates on the class itself, rather than an instance.\n","    - Uses cls as its first parameter, giving access to class variables and methods.\n","    - Useful for modifying or creating class-level data.\n","\n","23: How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n","  - Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables method overriding and promotes code reusability and flexibility.\n","\n","24: What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n","  - Method Chaining is a technique in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) where multiple methods are called on the same object in a single line. This is done by returning self from each method, allowing the next method to be invoked directly.\n","\n","25: What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n","  - The __call__ method in Python allows an instance of a class to be called like a function. It is a special (dunder) method that enables objects to behave as callable functions."],"metadata":{"id":"Pnd8unfYQxuz"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#Pratical Questions"],"metadata":{"id":"Kv84gRLD5Ssm"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# 1: Create a parent class Animal with a method speak() that prints a generic message.
